Most articles consist of paragraphs and images (perhaps with other types of audiovisual media).
However, articles may also be formatted as stand-alone lists or tables (not to be confused with disambiguation pages, which are purely navigation aids).
These lists or tables are also considered articles for Wikipedia's purposes and are included in the Main/Article namespace, the one without a title prefix followed by a colon.
On the this particular day of Christmas, the role of this uniform in red is used.
